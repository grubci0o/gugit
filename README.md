# Gugit
Gugit is a git clone that I wrote to familiarize myself with the inner workings of git.
It supports some of core git commands.

## Supported Commands
- diff

- checkout
## To Do's
- Add three way merge and fast-forward merge.
- Implement index (staging area).
- Consider using goroutines for hashing multiple files.
